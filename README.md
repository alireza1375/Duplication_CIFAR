## ðŸ“Œ Overview  

This work investigates the **impact of data duplication** on the training and robustness of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs).  

- We begin with a **theoretical overview** of how duplications in the training set affect **standard** and **robust (adversarially trained)** models.  
- Next, we examine the effect of duplication when data points are **sampled from a Gaussian distribution**.  
- Finally, we explore the impact of duplication on the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, comparing both **standard models** and **adversarially trained models** under duplicated data conditions.  

Our findings reveal how duplication can alter generalization, robustness, and the decision boundaries of neural networks.

## ðŸ“Š Datasets  

- **Gaussian Distribution (synthetic data)**  
  - Used to study theoretical behavior of duplication and visualize decision boundary changes.  

- **CIFAR-10**  
  - 60,000 color images (32Ã—32) in 10 classes.  
  - 50,000 training + 10,000 test images.  
  - Used to evaluate the practical effect of duplication on **standard** and **adversarially trained** models.
